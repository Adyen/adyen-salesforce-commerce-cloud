# Salesforce Commerce Cloud Adyen Cartridge

Adyen provides a LINK cartridge to integrate with [Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC)](https://www.adyen.com/partners/salesforce-commerce-cloud). This cartridge enables a SFCC storefront to use the Adyen payment service. This cartridge [supports](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/salesforce-commerce-cloud#supported-versions) SFRA version 5.x.x & 6.x.x and SiteGenesis JS-Controllers version 103.1.11 and higher.

## Integration
This cartridge allows you to integrate with Adyen without the need for any development work from your end. It allows you to process payments using the [checkout API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/v67/overview), and for Point of Sale (POS) payments, it uses a cloud-based [Terminal API](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/terminal-api-fundamentals). As for the client side, Adyenâ€™s [web components](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/components-web) are used to render payment methods.

## Requirements

It is required to have an Adyen account to use the cartridge. You can do this [here](https://www.adyen.com/signup).

## Installation, Usage and Configuration

Installation, Usage and Configuration is explained in Adyen's [online documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/salesforce-commerce-cloud/).

Apple Pay configuration can be found [here](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/salesforce-commerce-cloud/set-up-payment-methods/#set-up-apple-pay-on-the-web).

## Testing
End-to-End tests can be found in the `adyen-salesforce-commerce-cloud/tests/e2e` directory. 
They are run automatically via Github Actions using the `E2E.yml` workflow.
To run the tests locally use the following command:
```
`npm run test:e2e`
```
Note: Please make sure to fill in the environment variables in the `fixtures` directory before running the tests locally.

As for Unit tests, they are currently only available for SFRA. Test files can be found next to the files they are testing. Mocks are kept in the `jest` directory.
To run SFRA unit tests locally use the following command:
```
`npm run test`
```
## Support & Maintenance

We provide three levels of support:
1. **Level 1 (12 months)**: full support (including new features) *Keep in mind that some new features are not possible on older versions, therefore this is not inclusive of ALL new features that are built.* 
2. **Level 2 (12 months - 18 months)**: high priority bugs / security only.
3. **Level 3 (18 months - 24 months)**: security updates only (no support from support team).

> After Level 3 there is no support or maintenance from Adyen and it should be treated as a custom integration of the merchant.

The schedule for the current maintained branches is:

|  Plugin Major Version   |  Release Date  |  Level 1 Support ends   |  Level 2 Support ends   |  Level 3 Support ends  |
|  :-----          |  :-----          |  :-----          |  :-----          |  :-----          |
