# Salesforce Commerce Cloud Adyen Cartridge

Adyen provides a LINK cartridge to integrate with [Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC)](https://www.adyen.com/partners/salesforce-commerce-cloud). This cartridge enables a SFCC storefront to use the Adyen payment service. This cartridge supports SFRA version 4.x.x, 5.x.x, 6.x.x and SiteGenesis JS-Controllers version 103.1.11 and higher.

Please note that the cartridge is not compatible with SFRA version 4.3.x and 4.4.x due to a [bug](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/storefront-reference-architecture/pull/797) on Salesforce.

## Integration
This cartridge allows you to integrate with Adyen without the need for any development work from your end. It allows you to process payments using the [checkout API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/v67/overview), and for Point of Sale (POS) payments, it uses a cloud-based [Terminal API](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/terminal-api-fundamentals). As for the client side, Adyenâ€™s [web components](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/components-web) are used to render payment methods.

## Requirements

It is required to have an Adyen account to use the cartridge. You can do this [here](https://www.adyen.com/signup).
