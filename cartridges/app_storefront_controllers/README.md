# Welcome to Next Generation SiteGenesis

This SiteGenesis is now fully standard Javascript compliant using the new [Controllers]{@tutorial Controllers} concept to handle incoming requests. The controllers integrate nicely into a completely redesigned MVC concept which also includes [Models]{@tutorial Models} and [Views]{@tutorial Views}. All scripts are [Common JS modules](http://www.commonjs.org) with defined and documented exports to avoid polluting the global namespace.

This documentation is meant to serve as a reference to quickly lookup supported functionality and is fully based on the documentation inside the code. You can continue to maintain these [JSDoc comments](http://usejsdoc.org/) to generate a similar documentation for your own project.

Enjoy!
