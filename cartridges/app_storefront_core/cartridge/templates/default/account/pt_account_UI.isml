This template is intentionally empty.


The purpose is as a place holder for a template, with the same name 'higher up' in the cartridge path.

pt_xxx_UI.isml is 'injected' into pt_xxx.isml, in the <head> element, to enable custom cartridges to add script and css dependencies,

pt_xxx_VARS.isml is 'injected' into pt_xxx.isml, after the footer element (within the <body>, but near the end), for adding <script> elements that are only loaded after the markup is itself loaded.
